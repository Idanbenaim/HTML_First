    <p>We are Idan and Lihi Benaim, a married couple living in Kibbutz Gival Brenner. We are a fun-loving couple who enjoy spending time together and experiencing new things. We are both passionate about our lives and we have different interests that we share and enjoy together.</p>
    <p>Lihi is a teacher who loves to inspire and educate her students. She has a great sense of humor and she is always ready for a good laugh. She is a great listener and she is always there for her students and her family. </p>
    <p>As for me, I am a professional who enjoy my work and the challenges it brings. I am also a big fan of good food, I love to cook and to experiment with new recipes. I enjoy good company and a good conversation. </p>
    <p>Together, we love to watch movies, take trips across Israel, do walks together, go to the beach, and enjoy good food together, from dripping hamburgers, to fine wine with cheese and dried fruits. We also enjoy our time at home and we love to spend time with our family and friends. </p>
